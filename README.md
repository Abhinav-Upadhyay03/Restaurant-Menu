# Restaurant-Menu
Restaurant Menu is a dynamic front-end website built using React.js that displays a list of items served at a restaurant. The website classifies the items according to their meal times - breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.

The website is dynamic and interactive, pulling data from an API to display the items in real-time. When a new category of food is added to the API, the website will automatically load the new category without requiring any changes to the codebase.

## Usage
Once the website is launched, you can use it to browse the restaurant's menu. The items are categorized according to meal times and can be easily filtered using the navigation bar. The website is fully responsive and can be used on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

- React.js
